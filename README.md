# StudentPerformanceAnalysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze student quiz performance and predict future trends based on historical data. It uses machine learning to predict performance trends and provides insights on students' strengths and weaknesses, offering tailored recommendations to improve their learning experience.

Features

Data Loading and Cleaning:
Load and preprocess data from various sources, including current quizzes, submissions, and historical data.
Handle missing values and convert data into a usable format for analysis.

Performance Analysis:
Analyze the student's current quiz performance based on accuracy, correct/incorrect answers, and total questions.
Analyze historical quiz data to evaluate performance across different topics.

Machine Learning-Based Prediction:
Use linear regression to predict future quiz accuracy based on past performance trends.

Insights and Recommendations:
Provide insights on the student's weak and strong topics based on their historical performance.
Generate actionable recommendations to help students improve their learning strategy.

Student Persona:
Define the student persona based on their performance trends, categorizing them as a "Consistent Performer," "Focused Improver," "Beginner Learner," "Steady Improver," or "Balanced Learner."

Visualizations:
Provide visual insights using bar charts to display topic-wise performance and accuracy trends.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
To install the required libraries, run the following:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Files
The following JSON files are needed for data loading:
LLQT.json - Current quiz data
rJvd7g.json - Quiz submission data
XgAgFJ.json - Historical quiz data
Ensure these files are placed in the correct directory as indicated in the script.

Running the Project
Clone the repository or download the project folder.
Place the required .json files in the /content/ folder (or specify your custom path).
Run the Python script using any IDE (such as PyCharm, VSCode) or directly via the command line:
python analyze_performance.py

Approach
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
Data from three JSON files (current quiz, quiz submissions, and historical quizzes) is loaded into memory. The data is then normalized and cleaned to ensure proper types for numerical operations. Missing values are handled to ensure the integrity of the analysis.

2. Performance Analysis
Current quiz performance is analyzed by checking the number of correct and incorrect answers, as well as the overall accuracy percentage. Historical quiz data is grouped by topics, and statistics like average accuracy, total correct answers, and total incorrect answers are computed.

3. Predictive Modeling
A machine learning model using linear regression predicts the student's future quiz accuracy based on historical data. This helps in forecasting the student's progress.

4. Insights and Recommendations
Insights are derived by comparing weak and strong topics based on the student's average accuracy. Recommendations are generated to help the student focus on improving weaker areas and maintaining strengths.

5. Student Persona
The student's overall performance is analyzed to categorize them into a specific persona. This persona provides insight into their learning stage, such as whether they are a "Consistent Performer" or a "Beginner Learner."

6. Visualizations
Key performance metrics are visualized using bar charts that highlight the student's strengths and weaknesses in different topics.

Example Insights
Current Quiz Performance:
Total Questions: 20
Correct Answers: 15
Incorrect Answers: 5
Accuracy: 75%
Topic-Wise Performance:

Topic 1: Average Accuracy: 80%, Total Correct: 10, Total Incorrect: 2
Topic 2: Average Accuracy: 60%, Total Correct: 5, Total Incorrect: 8
Predicted Accuracy for Future Quizzes:

The model predicts a steady improvement in quiz accuracy based on historical trends.

Visualizations
Topic-Wise Performance Visualization
A bar chart visualizing the average accuracy for each topic helps to highlight areas where the student excels or needs improvement.

Performance Trend Prediction
The predicted trend of quiz performance over time helps to forecast future quiz accuracy.

Recommendations
Weak Topics: Focus on revising topics with accuracy less than 50%. Consider dedicating more time to understanding these topics through additional practice.
Strong Topics: Continue to perform well in strong topics, but challenge yourself with more complex questions to further improve your knowledge.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a student's quiz performance, offering valuable insights into their strengths and areas of improvement. By leveraging machine learning and data visualization techniques, it offers actionable recommendations to enhance their learning experience.
